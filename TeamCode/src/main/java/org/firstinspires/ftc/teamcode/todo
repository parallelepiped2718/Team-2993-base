[ ] Test goForward() function
[ ] Test goSideways() function
[ ] Test turn() function
[ ] (if needed) add a gradual slowdown to prevent skidding
[x] Write setLift() function -- function to set the lifts to a certain position (maybe just up or down for now)
[ ] Test setLift() function
[x] Write setClaw() function -- function to set the claw open or closed
[ ] Test setClaw function
[ ] Set up calls to grab cones and put them on the junction (will take significantly longer than the others)

NOTE: the motor encoders will build up error as they move, due to skidding when it stops and bc of just general lack of friction / wheel slipping / physics, so it is possible that we could eventually have enough error build up that we start to miss some of the cones. We might need to add sensors or something so that we know when we go past the junction or something
